# Function-Graph-Drawer
This project is a tool for plotting mathematical functions using Tkinter and Matplotlib. It supports plotting linear, parabolic, constant, identity and absolute value functions. While the program is optimized for Windows, it can also run on Linux and Mac, but window sizing might differ across operating systems.

## Prerequisites


Git (for cloning the repository)
   - Download and install Git from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.
  
To run this program, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

1. **Tkinter** (for the graphical user interface)
2. **Matplotlib** (for plotting graphs)
3. **Numpy** (for mathematical computations)
4. **Pillow** (for image processing - optional)
     
## Installation on Windows

To install these libraries on Windows, manually run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install tk
pip install numpy
pip install pillow
```

## How to run the program

After installing the prerequisites, run the program using the following command:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahdinetk/Function-Graph-Drawer.git
cd Function-Graph-Drawer
python draw-function-v2.py
```

## Cross-platform compatibility

This program runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. However, due to differences in window sizing across operating systems, the dimensions may appear different. It is recommended to run this program on Windows for the best experience.
